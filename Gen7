As a whole, Nikole Hannah-Jones presents evidence both that slavery and its effects did not end 150 years ago and that the near complete lack of initial capital meant that they were quickly forced back into near slavery conditions. The largest example of the negative rebound and lack of capital following the Civil War is shown in during the Redemption period where Hannah Jones states, "Through sharecropping and convict leasing, black people were compelled back into quasi slavery." An example of the negative policies that US had established following is the exclusion from numerous benefits and forms of aid, such as G.I. Bill, redlining, and the Fair Housing Act. All of these policies ultimately contributed and some continue to contribute to the systemic lack of wealth for Black Americans, which continues to compound in a lack of stability and prevents people from having a reasonable chance of increasing the accumulated wealth their family and communities have.
